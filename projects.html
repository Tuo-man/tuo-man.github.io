<h2>
First finished project: plywood and acrylic customn luminaire art piece:
</h2>

<p>
We were given an assignment from our Head Chief Instructor, Jari Uusitalo, to create an original luminaire with the laser cutter.<br>
<br>
As usual, a head full with thousands of ideas is not necessarily the most fruitful starting point for a project like this, so I ended up cramming most of the bright ideas into one.
<br>
One can easily imagine how well that went...<br>
<br>
Oh well, here is the process:

I first started with a random idea of a plywood box engraved and textured with moss texture patterns, so I quickly searched for few examples of traceable patterns one could use for free.

The next phase was to find out how to create a box out of plywood which can be assembled without any tools. <br>

    I had such a blast trying to combine two different type of boxes, one with six sides and finger joints and one with four sides and living hinges.. <br>
    <img src="img/screenshots/inkscape-prep_screenshots.gif" alt="Preparing the vector files"><br>
    Needless to say I had some trouble manually fixing the nodes from the combined different vector files. <br>

    Eventually with patience and lots of node clicks later I got somewhere. <br>

    I even got a working jigsaw puzzle lock for my box walls, fixed along with all the other nodes.

    I even got another moss-texture image from the G-search engine to make my forest even more vibrant and alive.<br>

    When making a forest, one would need a lots of different types of trees, that I sourced from the web in B&W image files for easy vectoring. <br>

   I found some ready made living hinge templates that I could print and test how they behave. <br>

    With an additional texture to the bottom of the box I found a slightly modified flower of life (sacred geometry) to be cut out for ventilation along with fine tuning the textures.

    The first test print was a great success...<br>

    <br> 
    Next phase was to raise the box from the base somehow and I opted to create some assemblable legs from plywood. <br>
    <br>
    With 3mm plywood for layer height, I needed ten layers to make up the 3cm legs. <br>
    The pegs were also stepped with three different peg cross-widths to accomodate snugly the different sizes of feet layers.

    The pegs turned out to be slightly more difficult to cut accurately to fit well but not too loosely when stacked.
