<p>
We were given an assignment from our Head Chief Instructor, Jari Uusitalo, to create an original luminaire with the laser cutter.<br>
<br>
As usual, a head full with thousands of ideas is not necessarily the most fruitful starting point for a project like this, so I ended up cramming most of the bright ideas into one.
<br>
One can easily imagine how well that went...<br>
<br>
Oh well, here is the process:

I first started with a random idea of a plywood box engraved and textured with moss texture patterns, <br>
so I quickly searched for few examples of traceable patterns one could use for free.<br>
I found <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/seamless-pattern-garlands-small-leaves-moss-texture-vectors-soft-green-white-print-textiles-fabrics-backgrounds-image208432052">
this</a> nice looking seamless vector pattern from <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/photos-images/moss-texture.html">Dreamstime.com</a>

The next phase was to find out how to create a box out of plywood which can be assembled without any tools. <br>

    I was fascinated by the living hinge type of compliant plywood kerf cutting and got lots of ideas from

    I had such a blast trying to combine two different type of boxes, one with six sides and finger joints and one with four sides and living hinges.. <br>

    I even got <a href="https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/abstract-concept-forest-moss-texture-tile-pattern-vector-25540866" alt="Moar moss">another moss-texture image</a> from the G-search engine to make my forest even more vibrant and alive.<br>

      When making a forest, one would need a lots of different types of trees, that I sourced from the web in B&W image files for easy vectoring. <br>

   I found some ready made <a href="https://www.trotec-materials.com/material-usage-hints/bending-trotec-materials">living hinge templates</a> I could print and test how they behave. <br>

    <img src="img/screenshots/1-25-inkscape_0tkuwwxnw5.png" alt="Back to drawing board">
    <div class="teksti">
    Went back to Inkscape to scale down the box model to 1/3. Just had to find a way to keep the finger joints and kerfs properly aligned.

    <br>

    After tedious realigning and fidgeting with the vector model, I was happy with the size of the box and also the texturing. (But only for a while)

      <img src="img/screenshots/1-30-inkscape_vuw6YMXlaR.png" alt="Texturing readish">
    <div class="teksti">
    Almost immediately I had to tweak the pattern on the box walls to make the engraving look deeper and darker, but now it was looking like it was supposed to.

    Next phase was to raise the box from the base somehow and I opted to create some assemblable legs from plywood. <br>

    <img src="img/screenshots/1-20-inkscape_5qYTlWxQga.png" alt="some sketches for the legs from wooden pegs">  
    <div class="teksti">
      With 3mm plywood for layer height, I needed ten layers to make up the 3cm legs. <br>

    <div class="teksti">
      The pegs were also stepped with three different peg cross-widths to accomodate snugly the different sizes of feet layers.

      The pegs turned out to be slightly more difficult to cut accurately to fit well but not too loosely when stacked.

    <img src="img/screenshots/01-36_inkscape_KqUc2qqucC.png" alt="Inkscape workspace screenshot"><br>
    <div class="teksti">
    So I kept on going and iterating the design for the cross pegs and the pads until it seemed to look okay.<br><br>
    </div>
    <img src="img/screenshots/01-39-inkscape_yH82WGcn2j.png" alt="Inkscape screenshot">
    <div class="teksti">
      I also added a slight engraving for the pads from the edge. <br>

    <img src="img/2-06-tassujen_leikkaus.gif" alt="Laser at work"> <img src="img/2-07-tassujen_leikkausta01.jpg" alt="Ready cut pads">

      These pads needed to be cut a few times before they were exactly the way they were supposed to be.<br>

<br>
<div class="moni">
  <div class="teksti">
    I started to sketch the becoming forest for the clear acrylic plates on top of the luminaire. <br>
    The downloaded tree silhouettes became handy by just spreading them apart nicely and creating a thicket type of forest scene.

  <div class="teksti">
    Some test engravings had to be done to ensure the desired efect of the trees in the acrylic.<br>

<img src="img/2-09-pienempi_Testiheksa.jpg" alt="finished test engraving"><br>
</div>

<div class="moni">
  <div class="teksti">
    Finished my design for the phantom forest on different acrylic plates after some tweaking of the opacity and the placement of the trees.<br>
    I also implemented an idea of stencil cutting the top portion of one of the hex plates with blue tinted acrylic mimicking the sky and the lower portion with green engraved acrylic for a forest background mockup.<br>

    After that it was only a matter of getting the final acrylic hex plates to engraved and cut with the laser.

  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="kuvat">
  <div class="teksti">
    Finally it was all a matter of getting the light inside, which was just cutting a LED-strip to convenient sized smaller strips and then soldering them together with wire.
  <br>
  </div>
  <img src="img/2-12-kolvattu_nauha01.jpg" alt="finished and soldered led strip"><br>
  <div class="teksti">
    Wasn't as easy as I thought at first but managed to get it done and working.<br>
    Note that I also added one additional white acrylic plate on the bottom the box to diffuse the light more evenly and support the clear plates better from the bottom of the box.<br>
  </div>
  <img src="img/2-13-melkein_valmiin_lootan_kasaus.jpg" alt="hex box with the LED-light strip neatly tucked inside"><br>
  <div class="teksti">
    The keenest of eyes might have also noticed the inner engraving pattern on the plywood (also on the white diffuser), which was mostly just a curiosity, as it doesn't really show at all from the finished box.<br>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="moni">
  <div class="teksti">
    One final test of the how the engraving would look like on the acrylic hex plates on top of the light box before final assembly.<br>
  </div>
  <img src="img/2-16-melkein_valmis_loota02.jpg" alt="assembly test">
  <div class="teksti">
    Then it was just a matter of putting it all together and finally assembling the box to finish it.<br>
  </div>
  <img src="img/2-15-melkein_valmis_loota.jpg" height="800px" alt="assembled box">
  <img src="img/2-20-valmis_loota03.jpg" height="800px" alt="final product"><br>
  <div class="teksti">
    ..which wasn't nearly as easily done than said, although after some slightly tougher love with a hammer for the plywood lid it was all in one solid finished piece.<br>
