<p>
We were given an assignment from our Head Chief Instructor, Jari Uusitalo, to create an original luminaire with the laser cutter.<br>
<br>
As usual, a head full with thousands of ideas is not necessarily the most fruitful starting point for a project like this, so I ended up cramming most of the bright ideas into one.
<br>
One can easily imagine how well that went...<br>
<br>
Oh well, here is the process:

I first started with a random idea of a plywood box engraved and textured with moss texture patterns, <br>
so I quickly searched for few examples of traceable patterns one could use for free.<br>
I found <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/seamless-pattern-garlands-small-leaves-moss-texture-vectors-soft-green-white-print-textiles-fabrics-backgrounds-image208432052">
this</a> nice looking seamless vector pattern from <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/photos-images/moss-texture.html">Dreamstime.com</a>

The next phase was to find out how to create a box out of plywood which can be assembled without any tools. <br>

  I found this site to be very useful for finding laser cut plans for boxes.

    I was fascinated by the living hinge type of compliant plywood kerf cutting and got lots of ideas from

    I had such a blast trying to combine two different type of boxes, one with six sides and finger joints and one with four sides and living hinges.. <br>

    I even got <a href="https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/abstract-concept-forest-moss-texture-tile-pattern-vector-25540866" alt="Moar moss">another moss-texture image</a> from the G-search engine to make my forest even more vibrant and alive.<br>

      When making a forest, one would need a lots of different types of trees, that I sourced from the web in B&W image files for easy vectoring. <br>

   I found some ready made <a href="https://www.trotec-materials.com/material-usage-hints/bending-trotec-materials">living hinge templates</a> I could print and test how they behave. <br>

    <div class="teksti">
    Went back to Inkscape to scale down the box model to 1/3. Just had to find a way to keep the finger joints and kerfs properly aligned.

    <br>

    After tedious realigning and fidgeting with the vector model, I was happy with the size of the box and also the texturing. (But only for a while)

      <img src="img/screenshots/1-30-inkscape_vuw6YMXlaR.png" alt="Texturing readish">
    <div class="teksti">
    Almost immediately I had to tweak the pattern on the box walls to make the engraving look deeper and darker, but now it was looking like it was supposed to.

    Next phase was to raise the box from the base somehow and I opted to create some assemblable legs from plywood. <br>

    <div class="teksti">
      With 3mm plywood for layer height, I needed ten layers to make up the 3cm legs. <br>

    <div class="teksti">
      The pegs were also stepped with three different peg cross-widths to accomodate snugly the different sizes of feet layers.

      The pegs turned out to be slightly more difficult to cut accurately to fit well but not too loosely when stacked.

    <div class="teksti">
    So I kept on going and iterating the design for the cross pegs and the pads until it seemed to look okay.<br><br>

    <img src="img/screenshots/01-39-inkscape_yH82WGcn2j.png" alt="Inkscape screenshot">
    <div class="teksti">
      I also added a slight engraving for the pads from the edge. <br>

<div class="moni">
  <div class="teksti">
    I started to sketch the becoming forest for the clear acrylic plates on top of the luminaire. <br>
    The downloaded tree silhouettes became handy by just spreading them apart nicely and creating a thicket type of forest scene.
